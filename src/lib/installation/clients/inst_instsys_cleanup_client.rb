# This is a client wrapper around the InstsysCleaner class.
# It tries to free memory by removing some files from inst-sys.
# This step should be called after the target system is partitioned
# because the cleanup might remove the kernel modules which are loaded
# during disk partitioning (e.g. the filesystem modules).
